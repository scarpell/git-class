Git Gud Speaker Outline - Day 1
-------------------------------
:hardbreaks:

The Basics
~~~~~~~~~~
The goal of this presentation is to give you an understanding of how *local* git works, and will not extensively
cover the syntax and associated _how to_ around using git. Specific syntax questions can be resolved at the end
of the presentation or via google.

Understand Your Audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Is there anyone that doesn't know git?
* If you were on a client site, would you be comfortable teaching them about git?
* What type of team environment did you use git in? Solo? Small Team? Army?

Commits
^^^^^^^
* *Q*:What is a commit?
** author, date, message, hash, parent
* The importance of commit messages
** Without a message, it's not a commit
** Not too much, but enough to remind of whats been done
* *Q*:What's the use of the hash?
** Easily made unique identifier of a given set of changes
* *Q*:What is the importance of the parent?
** Tracks the list of previous changes
** Creates a traversable linked list series of traversable changes
* *Q*:Why are commits immutable?
** Commits as cattle, not pets
** History as something that shouldn't be changed
* Commits are the *atomic unit* in git

*DEMO STARTS HERE*
(whiteboard or link:asciidoc[https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/])

*DEMO*
_set up a quick series of linear commits_

Branches
^^^^^^^^
* *Q*: Can anyone tell me, technically or conceptually, what a branch is?
** *Technically* - just a pointer
** *Conceptually* - a series of commits starting from a given point in history
** Super lightweight and easy to make and move
** Describe use cases
*** Sharing code
*** Distributed work
*** etc.

*DEMO*
_perform git branch feature_

* *Q*: What will happen at this point when I commit?
* *A*: Master will update, feature will stay
* Cover the difference between _git checkout -b_ and _git_checkout_
* Introduce the special *HEAD* pointer
** tracks your current location in git
** a pointer to a pointer
* Has anyone ever seen/heard of detached head?
** detached head means that your current HEAD pointer is not currently pointed at a branch
* *Q*: Anyone have ideas about why you might end up in this state?
** checking out a specific commit via HASH
** checking out with the *~*

*DEMO*
_check out a random unnamed commit, make a new commit in the detached HEAD state_

* *Q*: If head is on the commit, how do I get back to master
* *A*: git checkout master
* *Q*: How do I get to my previous commit?
* *A*: Git reflog

*DEMO*
_go back to the previous detached HEAD state, and set HEAD to the unmarked branch_

* *Q*: How do we preserve the changes that we've made prior to going back to master?
* *A*: git branch _<branch_name>_

*Checkpoint*: Check for understanding, and make sure the group understands all that's been covered

Possible Checkpoint exercises:

* walk through how all the pointers move after creating a commit
* what does git checkout HEAD~2 mean?
* walk through how all the references move after _git checkout -b_

Merging Branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* *Q*: Can anyone tell me what 'merging branches' means in git, and why we might want to do it?
* *A*: Merging branches is the action of combining any two branches from a single source repository in git
* Why?
** updating local code with 'upstream' changes
** combining work of multiple individuals
* a _merge_ in git takes one argument, the branch you want to bring in
* git assumes your current branch is the target of the merge
* Three different types of merges
** fast-forward
** non-fast-forward without conflicts
** non-fast-forward with conflicts

Fast-Forward Merges
+++++++++++++++++++
*DEMO*
_make a new branch off master and add some commits_

* walk through the actions of merging the new branch into master
* a FF commit can be summarized as simply moving the pointer of the current branch to the latest commit

Non Fast-Forward Merge
++++++++++++++++++++++
*DEMO*
_make a new branch off master and add some commits_
_go back to master and add some commits_

* walk through the actions of merging the new branch int master
* a non-FF commit will create a intermediary merge commit and point HEAD and your current branc pointer to that

Non Fast-Forward Merge w/ Conflicts
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
* logically, git is trying to perform the same actions as with a non-FF merge
* *Q*: Does anyone know how git defines a conflict?
* *A*: A conflict is when two files of the same name in the same directory location have different changes on the same line
* git does not take into account file context at all
* conflict resolution _mostly_ falls on the hands of the person looking to update their code
* frequent conflicts when working are usually a symptom of larger interpersonal or management issues around work


*Checkpoint*: Make sure everyone understands what is happening when brances are merging, and why conflicts might arise.

RECAP
~~~~~
* What is a commit?
* What is a branch?
* What is HEAD?
* What does _detached HEAD_ mean? How do we fix it?
* What is a conflict?
* Any other outstanding questions around local git?
